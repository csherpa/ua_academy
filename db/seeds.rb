# This file should contain all the record creation needed to seed the database with its default values.
# The data can then be loaded with the rails db:seed command (or created alongside the database with db:setup).
#
# Examples:
#
#   movies = Movie.create([{ name: 'Star Wars' }, { name: 'Lord of the Rings' }])
#   Character.create(name: 'Luke', movie: movies.first)


# Cohort.create(title: "Identity Course", description: 'teaches the students about the hero identity', instructor_id: 1, course_id: 1);
# Cohort.create(title: "Rescue Course", description: 'teaches the studnets about the rescue course', instructor_id: 2, course_id: 1);
