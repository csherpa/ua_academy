studentdiv = document.getElementById("student<%= student.id %>")

//console log that task that I clicked on 
console.log("Current task clicked " + studentdiv.innerText)

//Gave up here and had to use JQuery to replace the TR element becuase trs dont like forms inside of them 
$(studentdiv).replaceWith("<%= j (render 'form') %>");
